# Artificial Intelligence - DVA340
Repository created to store my solutions to the assignments given by the teacher in DVA340-Artificiell Intelligens, a course from Mälardalen University in Västerås.

# Assignment 1. Knapsack and Sudoku.
Part 1 consists of the knapsack problem, which must be resolved with BFS and DFS. 
That is done in part1.py, under 0.5 senconds of execution.
After turning in the code, I have received a 2.6/3 mark, due to some minor mathematical mistakes.

Part 2 consists of the sudoku problem, which must be solved with DFS.
That is done in part2.py, under 1 second of execution.
After turning in the code, I have received a 2/2 mark.

Total grade: 4.6/5.

#Assignment 2. Spain map. 
This assignment consists of creating a path between two Spanish cities, Malaga and Valladolid, 
using two different algorithms: Greedy best-first search algorithm and A* algorithm. 

After turning in the code, I have received a 5/5 mark.

#Assignment 3. Travelling salesman problem.
Part 1 consists of solving the travelling salesman problem using a Genetic Algorithm of our creation.
We need to start in location 1 and go through the 52 locations in Berlin with the shortest route possible, 
finishing also in location 1. 

After turning in the code, I have received a 1/1 mark. Still waiting to receive the mark on the report.

Part 2 consists of solving the same travelling salesman problem using an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.
We need to start in location 1 and go through the 52 locations in Berlin with the shortest route possible,
finishing also in location 1.

After turning in the code, I have received a ___ mark. Still waiting to receive the mark on the report.
