# Artificial Intelligence - DVA340
Repository created to store my solutions to the assignments given by the teacher in DVA340-Artificiell Intelligens, a course from Mälardalen University in Västerås.

# Assignment 1. Knapsack and Sudoku.
Part 1 consists of the knapsack problem, which must be resolved with BFS and DFS. 
That is done in part1.py, under 0.5 senconds of execution.
After turning in the code, I have received a 2.6/3 mark, due to some minor mathematical mistakes.

Part 2 consists of the sudoku problem, which must be solved with DFS.
That is done in part2.py, under 1 second of execution.
